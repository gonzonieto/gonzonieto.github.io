# TinyApp

TinyApp is a URL shortener.

This is a learning project for week 3 of Lighthouse Labs full-stack web development bootcamp.

The focus is to learn about HTTP requests and how to route those requests. The current implementation does not use a database, so changes do not persist.

See project requirements [here](/REQS.md).

## Tech Stack

* Server: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/)
* Templating: [EJS](https://ejs.co/)

### Future Directions / Personal Stretch Goals

* implement a web-friendly color palette
* add footer with link to GitHub project page
* write JSON objects to file and read from them on server start so that urlDatbase and users database can persist
* write a Node.js client using `axios` to perform all necessary tests
*
